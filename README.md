Project Overview
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

In this AWS project, we aim to visualize real-time data using Amazon QuickSight, Amazon S3, and Bright Data. The project involves extracting, storing, and analyzing data related to best-selling products. The insights gained from this data can be used for various business strategies, such as price comparison, product title analysis, and identifying leading sellers.

Project Steps
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

1. Navigate to Amazon S3:
   * Begin by accessing the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
   * This service will be used to store the data that will later be analyzed using QuickSight.

2. Create an S3 Bucket:
    * Create a new bucket with a unique name that adheres to S3 naming conventions.
    * The bucket will serve as the storage location for your data files.

3. Verify S3 Bucket Creation:
    * Ensure that the S3 bucket has been successfully created and is visible in your S3 dashboard.

 4. Download Real-Time Data from Bright Data:
    * Acquire real-time data related to best-selling products from Bright Data.
    * Once downloaded, upload the data file into the newly created S3 bucket.
  
5. Create and Upload a Manifest File:
   * Generate a manifest.json file containing details such as the S3 bucket name and the data file information.
   * Upload this manifest file into the S3 bucket, as it will be required by QuickSight to correctly identify and access the data.

6. Sign Up for Amazon QuickSight:
   * Navigate to the QuickSight service in the AWS console.
   * Sign up for QuickSight, which will be used for data visualization and analysis.

7. Verify QuickSight Account Creation:
   * Confirm that your QuickSight account has been successfully created and is ready for use.

8. Create a Dataset in QuickSight:
   * Within QuickSight, create a new dataset by importing the data stored in your S3 bucket.
   * Provide all necessary information, such as the location of the manifest file, to enable QuickSight to load and analyze the data.

9. Analyze Best-Selling Products:
   * The dataset consists of detailed information on 50,000 best-selling Amazon products.
   * Use QuickSight to visualize and analyze this data, allowing you to compare prices, and identify top-performing sellers.


Conclusion:
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

This project demonstrates how AWS services like S3 and QuickSight, combined with external data sources like Bright Data, can be used to effectively manage and analyze large datasets. The visualizations created through QuickSight provide valuable insights that can drive data-driven decision-making in various business contexts.
